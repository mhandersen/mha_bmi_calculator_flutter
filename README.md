# mha_bmi_calculator_flutter

A simple BMI Flutter application. Based on lesson from this course: https://www.appbrewery.co/p/flutter-development-bootcamp-with-dart

## Changed
This version uses Named Routes and passes the CalculatorBrain object to the ResultsPage and using properties instead of methods.

I prefer to pass an object using Named Routes instead of a bunch of parameters. Also this goes better with the ViewModel kind-of-thinking I am used to when using ASP.NET MVC etc.

Enjoy! :-)
